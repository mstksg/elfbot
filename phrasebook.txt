Ho ho ho!
Deck the channels!
Joy to the freenode!
I just elfed myself!
Have you been naughty or nice?
Won't you guide my debugger tonight?
Calling all reindeer!
Run that checksum twice!
Yule be in for a treat!
A round of Santa-plause, please.
Let it snow!
Jingle \a, jingle all the way!
Hoooo ho ho!
Do you hear what I hear?
Who's ready for Christmas cheer?
Get out the hot cocoa!
I'm dreaming of a bug-free Christmas!
My list is formally verified twice!
Now Dasher, now Dancer!
It's the most wonderful time of the year!
Francisco!
Son of a nutcracker!
Has anyone seen my sleigh?
Sharpen up your elfcode!
Sing loud for all to hear!
Time to spread some Christmas cheer!
It's silly, but I believe!
Yipee ki-yay, coders!
Welcome to the party, pal.
I'll be $HOME for Christmas!
Hark!
Hooo ho ho!
Ho ho hoooo!
Rest ye merry CPUs!
Code yourself a merry little Christmas!
Must've been some magic in that old compiler!
